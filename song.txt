sword and spear
wall of shields
She woke up in the morning
With the sunrise in her eyes
But all that she sees is darkness
She won't tell you why

No more butterflies 'cause they don't never last
Stolen from the light by demons of the past
It's always raining
But she keeps on praying
Oh, sunny days
Lift me when I'm down
